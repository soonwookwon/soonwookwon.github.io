However, the risk properties of existing estimators are fragile to violations of the underlying distributional assumptions. I develop an estimator for the fixed effects that obtains the best possible mean squared error within a class of shrinkage estimators. This class includes conventional estimators, and the optimality does not require distributional assumptions. Importantly, the fixed effects are allowed to vary with time and to be serially correlated, and the shrinkage optimally incorporates the underlying correlation structure in this case. In such a context, I also provide a method to forecast fixed effects one period ahead.","tags":null,"title":"Optimal Shrinkage Estimation of Fixed Effects in Linear Panel Data Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiafeng Chen","Jiaying Gu","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1742774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1742774400,"objectID":"8eff302c9e3e748311dabf8dc1cd03a5","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/cgk_ebreg_2025/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cgk_ebreg_2025/","section":"publication","summary":"In the value-added literature, it is often claimed that regressing on empirical Bayes shrinkage estimates corrects for the measurement error problem in linear regression.

This paper develops tests for the ``sharp null of full mediation'' that the treatment $D$ operates on the outcome $Y$ only through a particular conjectured mechanism (or set of mechanisms) $M$. A key observation is that if $D$ is randomly assigned and has a monotone effect on $M$, then $D$ is a valid instrumental variable for the local average treatment effect (LATE) of $M$ on $Y$. Existing tools for testing the validity of the LATE assumptions can thus be used to test the sharp null of full mediation when $M$ and $D$ are binary. We develop a more general framework that allows one to test whether the effect of $D$ on $Y$ is fully explained by a potentially multi-valued and multi-dimensional set of mechanisms $M$, allowing for relaxations of the monotonicity assumption. We further provide methods for lower-bounding the size of the alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how $M$ is assigned; on the other hand, our approach helps to answer different questions than traditional mediation analysis by focusing on the sharp null rather than estimating average direct and indirect effects. We illustrate the usefulness of the testable implications in two empirical applications.","tags":null,"title":"Testing Mechanisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soonwoo Kwon","Jonathan Roth"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1713312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713312000,"objectID":"b819fb50da8d80b994602544cdc0ec32","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kr_ebdid_2024/","publishdate":"2024-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kr_ebdid_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider Bayes and Empirical Bayes (EB) approaches for dealing with violations of parallel trends.

Two issues are addressed. First, standard tests and confidence sets for the true parameter in the moment inequality literature are not robust to model misspecification in the sense that they exhibit spurious precision when the identified set is empty. This paper introduces tests and confidence sets that provide correct asymptotic inference for a pseudo-true parameter in such scenarios, and hence, do not suffer from spurious precision. Second, specification tests have relatively low power against a range of misspecified models. Thus, failure to reject the null of correct specification does not necessarily provide evidence of correct specification. That is, model specification tests are subject to the problem that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This paper develops new diagnostics for model misspecification in moment inequality models that do not suffer from this problem.","tags":null,"title":"Misspecified Moment Inequality Models: Inference and Diagnostics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Armstrong","Michal Kolesár","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"2e36205caac177ea8d3c560d1af45320","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/akk_regreg_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akk_regreg_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider inference on a regression coefficient under a constraint on the magnitude of the control coefficients. We show that a class of estimators based on an auxiliary regularized regression of the regressor of interest on control variables exactly solves a tradeoff between worst-case bias and variance. We derive “bias-aware” confidence intervals (CIs) based on these estimators, which take into account possible bias when forming the critical value. We show that these estimators and CIs are near-optimal in finite samples for mean squared error and CI length. Our finite-sample results are based on an idealized setting with normal regression errors with known homoskedastic variance, and we provide conditions for asymptotic validity with unknown and possibly heteroskedastic error distribution. Focusing on the case where the constraint on the magnitude of control coefficients is based on an $\\scriptsize\\ell_p$ norm (p ≥ 1), we derive rates of convergence for optimal estimators and CIs under high-dimensional asymptotics that allow the number of regressors to increase more quickly than the number of observations.","tags":null,"title":"Bias-Aware Inference in Regularized Regression Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koohyun Kwon","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"1bd9189b7522fcc30cf8da11c18b9098","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kk_rdd_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kk_rdd_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We provide an inference procedure for the sharp regression discontinuity  design (RDD) under monotonicity, with possibly multiple running  variables. Specifically, we consider the case where the true regression  function is monotone with respect to (all or some of) the running variables  and assumed to lie in a Lipschitz smoothness class. Such a monotonicity  condition is natural in many empirical contexts, and the Lipschitz constant  has an intuitive interpretation.  We propose a minimax two-sided  confidence interval (CI) and an adaptive one-sided CI. For the two-sided CI,  the researcher is required to choose a Lipschitz constant where she believes  the true regression function to lie in. This is the only tuning parameter, and the resulting CI has uniform coverage and obtains  the minimax optimal length. The one-sided CI can be constructed to maintain  coverage over all monotone functions, providing maximum credibility in terms  of the choice of the Lipschitz constant.  Moreover, the monotonicity makes it  possible for the (excess) length of the CI to adapt to the true Lipschitz  constant of the unknown regression function. Overall, the  proposed procedures make it easy to see under what conditions on the  underlying regression function the given estimates are significant, which can  add more transparency to research using RDD methods.","tags":null,"title":"Inference in Regression Discontinuity Designs under Monotonicity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koohyun Kwon","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"758024490faef8ede746a12172b686b1","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kk_aimn_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kk_aimn_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of adaptive inference on a regression function at a point under a multivariate nonparametric regression setting.

Since it is unknown in practice whether the imposed smoothness restriction is met, it is desirable to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the smoothness assumption. We demonstrate how one can carry out a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect by varying the degrees of smoothness assumption. We illustrate our findings by reanalyzing the return to schooling example of Manski and Pepper (2000) and also by measuring the effect of the length of job training on the labor market outcomes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Identification Power Of Smoothness Assumptions In Models With Counterfactual Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soonwoo Kwon","Sokbae Lee","Jihong Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1508803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508803200,"objectID":"5e65f2a0bfa545402672dae1aee82d61","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kll_2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kll_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
