However, the risk properties of existing estimators are fragile to violations of the  underlying distributional assumptions. I develop an estimator for the fixed  effects that obtains the best possible mean squared error (MSE) within a class  of shrinkage estimators. This class includes conventional estimators, and the  optimality does not require distributional assumptions. Importantly, the fixed  effects are allowed to vary with time and to be serially correlated, and the  shrinkage optimally incorporates the underlying correlation structure in this  case. In such a context, I also provide a method to forecast fixed effects one  period ahead. A simulation study shows that the proposed estimator  substantially reduces the MSE relative to conventional methods when the  distributional assumptions of the conventional methods are violated, and loses  very little when the assumptions are met. Using administrative data on the  public schools of New York City, I estimate a teacher value-added model and  show that the proposed estimator makes an empirically relevant difference. An  optimized R package, FEShR, to implement the proposed method is  provided.","tags":null,"title":"Optimal Shrinkage Estimation of Fixed Effects in Linear Panel Data Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koohyun Kwon","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"1bd9189b7522fcc30cf8da11c18b9098","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kk_rdd_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kk_rdd_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We provide an inference procedure for the sharp regression discontinuity  design (RDD) under monotonicity, with possibly multiple running  variables. Specifically, we consider the case where the true regression  function is monotone with respect to (all or some of) the running variables  and assumed to lie in a Lipschitz smoothness class. Such a monotonicity  condition is natural in many empirical contexts, and the Lipschitz constant  has an intuitive interpretation.  We propose a minimax two-sided  confidence interval (CI) and an adaptive one-sided CI. For the two-sided CI,  the researcher is required to choose a Lipschitz constant where she believes  the true regression function to lie in. This is the only tuning parameter, and the resulting CI has uniform coverage and obtains  the minimax optimal length. The one-sided CI can be constructed to maintain  coverage over all monotone functions, providing maximum credibility in terms  of the choice of the Lipschitz constant.  Moreover, the monotonicity makes it  possible for the (excess) length of the CI to adapt to the true Lipschitz  constant of the unknown regression function. Overall, the  proposed procedures make it easy to see under what conditions on the  underlying regression function the given estimates are significant, which can  add more transparency to research using RDD methods.","tags":null,"title":"Inference in Regression Discontinuity Designs under Monotonicity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koohyun Kwon","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"758024490faef8ede746a12172b686b1","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kk_aimn_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kk_aimn_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We derive minimax rates of convergence for adaptive confidence intervals (CIs) in a multivariate nonparametric regression setting. The regression function is assumed to be monotone with respect to some of the arguments. We provide inference procedures that obtain such minimax rates. The adaptive CIs are constructed by using a different procedure from that of Cai and Low (2004). The suggested procedure applies to general linear functionals of the regression function, and is shown to have superior performance compared to other adaptive procedures when the number of parameter spaces that we adapt to is not too large.","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Inference in Multivariate Nonparametric Regression Models Under Monotonicity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donald Andrews","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"847bb965fa04adefe6f5fb7659c52718","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/ak_2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ak_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Standard tests and confidence sets in the moment inequality literature are not robust to model misspecification in the sense that they exhibit spurious precision when the identified set is empty.

We obtain a set of new partial identification results for both the average treatment response and the average treatment effect. In particular, we find that the monotone treatment response and monotone treatment selection bound of Manski and Pepper (2000) can be further tightened if we impose the smoothness conditions on the treatment response. Since it is unknown in practice whether the imposed smoothness restriction is met, it is desirable to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the smoothness assumption. We demonstrate how one can carry out a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect by varying the degrees of smoothness assumption. We illustrate our findings by reanalyzing the return to schooling example of Manski and Pepper (2000) and also by measuring the effect of the length of job training on the labor market outcomes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Identification Power Of Smoothness Assumptions In Models With Counterfactual Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soonwoo Kwon","Sokbae Lee","Jihong Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1508803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508803200,"objectID":"5e65f2a0bfa545402672dae1aee82d61","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kll_2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kll_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
