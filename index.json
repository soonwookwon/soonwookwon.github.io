When treatment effects are heterogeneous, however, such specifications generally fail to recover this average effect. Augmenting these specifications with interaction terms between demeaned covariates and treatment eliminates this bias, but often leads to imprecise estimates and becomes infeasible under limited overlap. We propose a generalized ridge regression estimator, 𝚛𝚎𝚐𝚞𝚕𝚊𝚃𝙴, that penalizes the coefficients on the interaction terms to achieve an optimal trade-off between worst-case bias and variance in estimating the average effect under limited treatment effect heterogeneity. Building on this estimator, we construct confidence intervals that remain valid under limited overlap and can also be used to assess sensitivity to violations of the constant effects assumption. We illustrate the method in empirical applications under unconfoundedness and staggered adoption, providing a practical approach to inference under limited overlap.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating Treatment Effects Under Bounded Heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1757030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1757030400,"objectID":"65b5785fae437ebd6047c556ec48229f","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/jmp/","publishdate":"2025-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jmp/","section":"publication","summary":"Shrinkage methods are frequently used to estimate fixed effects.

Our approach exploits connections between mediation analysis and the econometric literature on testing instrument validity. We also provide tools for quantifying the magnitude of alternative mechanisms when the sharp null is rejected: we derive sharp lower bounds on the fraction of individuals whose outcome is affected by the treatment despite having the same value of $M$ under both treatments ('always-takers'), as well as sharp bounds on the average effect of the treatment for such always-takers. An advantage of our approach relative to existing tools for mediation analysis is that it does not require stringent assumptions about how $M$ is assigned.

Two issues are addressed. First, standard tests and confidence sets for the true parameter in the moment inequality literature are not robust to model misspecification in the sense that they exhibit spurious precision when the identified set is empty. This paper introduces tests and confidence sets that provide correct asymptotic inference for a pseudo-true parameter in such scenarios, and hence, do not suffer from spurious precision. Second, specification tests have relatively low power against a range of misspecified models. Thus, failure to reject the null of correct specification does not necessarily provide evidence of correct specification. That is, model specification tests are subject to the problem that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. This paper develops new diagnostics for model misspecification in moment inequality models that do not suffer from this problem.","tags":null,"title":"Misspecified Moment Inequality Models: Inference and Diagnostics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothy Armstrong","Michal Kolesár","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1690848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848000,"objectID":"2e36205caac177ea8d3c560d1af45320","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/akk_regreg_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akk_regreg_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider inference on a regression coefficient under a constraint on the magnitude of the control coefficients.

We show that these estimators and CIs are near-optimal in finite samples for mean squared error and CI length.

Such a monotonicity  condition is natural in many empirical contexts, and the Lipschitz constant  has an intuitive interpretation.  We propose a minimax two-sided  confidence interval (CI) and an adaptive one-sided CI. For the two-sided CI,  the researcher is required to choose a Lipschitz constant where she believes  the true regression function to lie in. This is the only tuning parameter, and the resulting CI has uniform coverage and obtains  the minimax optimal length. The one-sided CI can be constructed to maintain  coverage over all monotone functions, providing maximum credibility in terms  of the choice of the Lipschitz constant.  Moreover, the monotonicity makes it  possible for the (excess) length of the CI to adapt to the true Lipschitz  constant of the unknown regression function. Overall, the  proposed procedures make it easy to see under what conditions on the  underlying regression function the given estimates are significant, which can  add more transparency to research using RDD methods.","tags":null,"title":"Inference in Regression Discontinuity Designs under Monotonicity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Koohyun Kwon","Soonwoo Kwon"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"758024490faef8ede746a12172b686b1","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kk_aimn_2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kk_aimn_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the problem of adaptive inference on a regression function at a point under a multivariate nonparametric regression setting.

Since it is unknown in practice whether the imposed smoothness restriction is met, it is desirable to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to the smoothness assumption. We demonstrate how one can carry out a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect by varying the degrees of smoothness assumption. We illustrate our findings by reanalyzing the return to schooling example of Manski and Pepper (2000) and also by measuring the effect of the length of job training on the labor market outcomes.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The Identification Power Of Smoothness Assumptions In Models With Counterfactual Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soonwoo Kwon","Sokbae Lee","Jihong Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1508803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1508803200,"objectID":"5e65f2a0bfa545402672dae1aee82d61","permalink":"https://soonwookwon.github.io/publication/kll_2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kll_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
